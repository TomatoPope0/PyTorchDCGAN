# PyTorch Implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)

This is my implementation of DCGAN (Radford, 2016) in PyTorch (Pazkea et al., 2019).

As I'm an active learning student, this implementation may not be complete or accurate. Therefore, I recommend you to use other reliable implementations if you're willing to use it in your project.

If you find any bugs or flaws, please let me know. Also, I tried using the APA style citation, just for practicing. If you think any of the citations are improper, please let me know.
